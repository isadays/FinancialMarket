# Financial Market
Personal notes -  Financial Market Course from Yale University 

## VaR - Quantifying risk
- VAR in finance means two things: variance (measure of variability) and value at risk, but when A is not capitalized, it means the value at risk

- 1% one year VaR of $10 million means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose $10 million in a year

- 5% 3-month VaR of $ 1 million means 5% chance that a portfolio will lose $1 million in 3 months; in other words = 5% chance of the asset declining in value by $1 million during the 3-month time frame.

## Insurance principles and issues

- risk pooling is the source of all value in insurance (binomial distribution)

- moral hazard dealt with partially by deductions and co-insurance

- selection bias dealt  with group policies, by testing and referrals, and by mandatory government insurance

-  insurance is a local phenomenon
